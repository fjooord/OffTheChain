# OffTheChain
Simple game made in python processing where a chain chomp breaks off its chain and chases around Toad.
Completed Work:
- Made characters using self written geometries and matrix stack
- Implemented basic character control of the chomp character using the wasd keys
- Implemented a basic game engine to handle logic of the game, ie collision with walls and capture of the toad
- Implemented a basic AI for Toad where it will go the location farther away from the player by Euclidian distance
- Created procedural animations for the movement of game characters
- Created a procedural particle simulation for the breaking of the chain 
- Create a random street grid generator for when the player chases around Toad
- Learned the importance of properly structuring a game for running on limited processing power

Future Work:
- Update toad AI to look 2 moves ahead for better movement interpolation
- Update particle system animation to look more like an explosion
- Create tile for the streets, grass, and walls to make them look better
- Implement turning interpolation for the player
- Animate the tail of the chomp
