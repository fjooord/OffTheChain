# OffTheChain
Simple game made in python processing where a chain chomp breaks off its chain and chases around Toad.
- Made characters using self written geometries and matrix stack
- Implemented basic character control of the chomp character using the wasd keys
- Implemented a basic game engine to handle logic of the game, ie collision with walls and capture of the toad
- Created procedural animations for the movement of game characters
- Created a procedural particle simulation for the breaking of the chain 
- Create a random street grid generator for when the player chases around Toad
- Learned the importance of properly structuring a game for running on limited processing power
